    <p class="main_content"> We're hosting an in-person meetup at NIEC on 28th October, from 10 am - 3 pm, to gather all free and open source enthusiasts from the Delhi city to contribute to open source projects together.  <br/><br/>
        Hacktoberfest is an annual  month-long event to celebrate and encourage more developers to become involved with open source software. It's open for anyone, especially beginners just getting started with open source! <br/><br/>
        In this meetup, we'll take a beginner friendly session on Git and GitHub. <br/><br/>
